                  Various pathogenic microorganisms can survive and spread via

                  Surfaces that are often touched such as doorknobs, handrails,

                  handles, tables and more are most likely to be contaminated.
                  Since many viruses and microorganisms can survive on such
                  surfaces for a significant amount of time, it is critical for
                  offices to invest in sanitisation services.

                  Kobzoâ€™s sanitisation services include liquid sterilisation to
                  prevent microbial growth on all surfaces of the premises. To
                  achieve 99.9% efficiency, it is critical to conduct the
                  process every 3 hours when any movement takes place or every
                  24 hours if no movement takes place. For this reason, Kobzo
                  assists you in not only sanitizing effectively but in only
                  working out a schedule suited to your organization.

                  There are at least 200,000 different microorganisms in
                  addition to dust mites and allergens per square inch of
                  carpets. Various viruses can survive in carpets for weeks
                  before becoming airborne.

                  Kobzo recognizes that carpet cleaning services largely depend
                  on a companyâ€™s operations and thus provides professional
                  carpet cleaning services that can be trusted to remove
                  stubborn stains, dirt, soil and grease from carpets that are
                  not removed via regular vacuuming or wiping.

                  A survey found that 98% of workers in office spaces catch
                  either minor or more severe illnesses that are contagious
                  where a major contributing factor is the cleanliness of the
                  office. In fact, if regular cleaning and disinfecting is not
                  performed, offices can expect an increase in bacteria present
                  on office surfaces by around 31% each day. With the advent of
                  the COVID-19 pandemic, it is extremely important for all
                  companies to revamp their hygiene maintenance.

                  Kobzoâ€™s services will also help offices maintain regular
                  cleaning cycles and proper training of the relevant staff.
